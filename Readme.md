# Task 1.
Write a function that takes an object as an argument and prints all keys and values of its own properties to the console. This function should not return a value.
# Task 2.
Write a function that takes a string and an object as arguments, and then checks if the passed object has a property with that name. The function should return true or false.
# Task 3.
Write a function that creates an empty object without a prototype.
# Task 4.
Implement the following console application similar to the example discussed in the video. Implement it using prototypes.
Define a hierarchy of electrical appliances. Plug some of them into the socket. Calculate the total power consumption of all connected devices (pass the argument).
There should be at least two such devices (for example, a table lamp and a computer). When choosing a device, think about what properties it has.
Plan:
Define a parent function with methods that turn on / off the device from the socket.
Create a delegating [[Prototype]] connection for two specific devices.
Each device should have its own properties and, preferably, methods that differ from the parent methods.
Create instances of each device.
Output to the console and see the results of the work, you can be proud of yourself :)
General requirements:
The names of functions, properties and methods should be informative.
Follow best practices:
use camelCase notation for variables and methods, PascalCase for function names and class constructors;
informative names (not a, b);
a clear connection between a class and its instances (the class describes a set, and the instance is a concrete implementation);
use ES6 syntax (except for constructor functions), etc.
# Task 5.
Rewrite the console application from the previous unit to classes.
General requirements:
Class, property and method names should be informative.
Follow best practices.
Use ES6 syntax.
